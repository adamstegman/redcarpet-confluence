# Title

Some paragraph of text.  
A new line of text.

* here
* are
* some
* bullets

1. and
2. numbered
3. list

Name | Value
-----|------
a    | 1
b    | 2

Now let's get to *formatting* this **text**. See how ***bold*** I can getâ€½

I can do math: x^2 + 3x + 2 = ~~(x + 3)~~ (x + 2)(x + 1)

## Subheading

```ruby
puts "Some ruby code"
```

### Deeper subheading

    some _anonymous_ code

#### Still going deeper

> quoted text _with_ **emphasis**

##### We must go deeper

Text with a `codespan` in the middle.

###### Finally

We're ***here***
